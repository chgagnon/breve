# i knew these two people. 
# and, um...a boy and a girl, 
# and they liked to hang together. 
#  
# they were nice people. 
# um...they were the people, 
# that made you feel good 
# to be around. 
#  
# anyway, the thing was, 
# one day, they started acting 
# kinda funny...kinda weird. 
#  
# they started being seen, 
# exchanging tokens of affection. 
# and there were rumors that they were, 
# engaging in...
#  
# i think that they'd run out of time.

# you know what happened to them? 
# you know what they do?
