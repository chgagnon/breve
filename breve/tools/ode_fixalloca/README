*** ode_fixalloca ***

The release version of ODE uses alloca() to allocate memory
on the stack during function calls.  During large simulations,
the memory required can cause a stack overflow, which will 
crash breve.

Though you can compile breve with the release ODE as is, the
binary releases of breve will use the modified ODE libary to
protect against crashes.

The Perl script and C program here are used to replace the 
alloca()'s with calls to malloc(), and add the appropriate 
free() calls at the end of the functions.

These scripts do MOST of the work, but do not work perfectly.
In the case that an alloc() statement (or variable definition)
is ifdef'd out, for example, the scripts will still add a free 
at the end of the function call.  YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE A 
FEW CHANGES TO THE SOURCES BEFORE COMPILING THE MODIFIED 
LIBRARY.
