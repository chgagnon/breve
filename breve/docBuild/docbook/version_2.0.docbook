Below are some of the major new features found in breve 2.2.  For a full 
list of new features, see the "Changes" file that is included with the 
breve distribution.

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>
New breveIDE graphical user interface for Linux and Windows (thanks to Gabriel Tarasuk-Levin)
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>
steve code evaluation greatly optimized (thanks to Michael Larson).

  <listitem><para>
New hardware accelerated Matrix3D class (thanks to Eric DeWitt).
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>
Memory requirements, initialization time and collision detection costs greatly reduced for 
large simulations.  breve is now capable of simulating far more objects than previously 
possible.

<sect1 id="upgrading_simulations"> <title>Upgrading Simulations From Version 1.x</title>

<para>A number of changes introduced in breve 2.0 may require small changes to simulations written
in previous versions of breve (1.x).  These changes and instructions on upgrading simulations 
are discussed below.

<sect2 id="multibody_changes">
<title>Changes to MultiBody Functionality</title>

<para>MultiBodies are now optional.  Some MultiBody functionality has
changed, and some MultiBody methods have been removed. </para> 

<para>The MultiBody class is used to manage a logical collection of connected
links.  Prior to version 2.0, all physically connected objects were
required to be part of a MultiBody.  This lead to complications when
multiple MultiBodies would merge to form a single body, or when a single
MultiBody would split to become two bodies. </para> 

<para>In version 2.0, MultiBody objects are now optional.  The Link class 
is now a subclass of Mobile, so Links can be created as real objects in the
simulated world, and can be connected or disconnected from other links
as desired.  The MultiBody object is now a distinct class.  It can be
used, if desired, to move or rotate a group of connected link objects,
but it is otherwise not required for physically simulated bodies.
</para> 

<para>Some of the methods which MultiBody previously inherited
from the Real class are now no longer available (since MultiBody is no
longer a subclass of Real or Mobile).  You must now call these methods
directly on the link objects associated with the MultiBody.  The method
get-all-connected-links will help you </para>

<para>Freeing a MultiBody will also no longer free all of the connected
Link and Joint objects, and the associated bodies will remain in the
simulation.  If you want to destroy the simulated objects, you should
call the method free-all-connected-objects before freeing the
MultiBody.</para>

<para>If your simulation made use of MultiBodies prior to version 2.0, you may
need to modify your simulation to account for the changes described
above.</para> </sect2>

<sect2 id="array_depreciated"> <title>Arrays Are Now
Decprecated</title> <para>The use of arrays has now been deprecated
and will be removed from a future release of breve: use lists
instead</para>

<para>Lists have all of the functionality of arrays and more.  Arrays
existed for a short time before lists had been implemented, and have
been around ever since, though they are only rarely used. </para>

<para>As of version 1.9, lists are indexed for fast access so that
repeated list accesses are as fast as array accesses. </para>

<para>If your simulation uses arrays, you should convert them to lists
to ensure compatibility in the future.</para> </sect2>

<sect2 id="data_removed">
<title>The Data Class is Now Obsolete</title>

<para>The Data class has been deprecated and will be removed from a
future release of breve.</para>

<para>Because archiving and networking has been improved and allows for
archiving of complex types such as objects and lists, the Data class is
now obsolete.  It will be removed from a future version of breve.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="visions_removed">
<title>The "Visions" class has been removed</title>

<para>The same functionality can be reproduced using the new "Camera"
class and the updated "Image" class.</para>

<para>The "Visions" class was used to provide the user with pixel
buffers of rendered perspectives in the simulated world.  This allowed
multiple rendered perspectives in the main viewing window, but it also
required reading pixels from the graphics card at each time step, an
operation which is somewhat slow.</para>

<para>The new Camera class allows multiple perspectives to be rendered
to the main output window without the slow pixel reading step.  The
updated Image class now allows pixels to be read from the main output
window as desired.  The Image class provides all of the functionality of
the Vision class, and more: its pixels can be read or modified, it can
be written to disk or used to texture another object in the simulation,
and it can provide a pointer to raw pixel data.</para>

<para>One important note regarding differences between the Vision class
and the Image class: Visions stored three separate pixel buffers for
red, green, blue data.  The Image class stores a single buffer
containing interleaved red, green, blue and alpha pixels.</para>

<para>If your simulation used the Vision class in a prior version of
breve, it will need to use the Camera and Image objects to preform the
same functionality in the current version of breve.</para></sect2>

<sect2 id="texture_changes">
<title>Loading Textures From the Controller Class is Now Deprecated</title>

<para>Obtaining a "texture number" by loading an image from the Control
class is now deprecated, as is using a texture number to set a texture,
bitmap or lightmap.  You should now load an image using the Image class,
and use the Real object methods set-texture-image, set-bitmap-image and
set-lightmap-image to apply textures, bitmaps and images.</para>

<para>The Image class provides much better control over textures than
the previous method.</para>
