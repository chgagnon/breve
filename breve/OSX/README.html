<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<I>breve</I> is a simulation environment which allows users to define the behaviors and interactions of different types of agents in a simulated 3D world and observe the emergent behaviors.  <I>breve</I> is conceptually similar to packages such as Swarm and StarLogo, but simulates objects in a continuous 3D world with continuous time.  <I>breve</I> thus allows simulation involving realistic collision detection and physics.  
<P>
Agent behaviors are written in a simple object oriented language called "steve".  Users define an agent's behavior by specifying how the agent interacts with the world at each timestep and how the agent interacts when it collides with other agents.
<P>
<I>breve</I> includes full collision detection and physical simulation of rigid bodies.  See the Walker and Gravity simulations for examples.  
<P>
For a more detailed introduction of the <I>breve</I> environment, refer to the introductory paper at: <A HREF="http://www.spiderland.org/breve">http://www.spiderland.org/breve</a>.
<P>
This release is version 2.0.  Many changes have been made from release 1.9, so please read the Changes file to find out what's new.

<h4><b>getting started</b></h4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The best way to get started and learn about programming in steve is to examine the demos from the demos menu and watch them run.  The most simple demo showing how objects move around the world are  RandomWalker.  A fun demo showing how collisions can be handled is the DLA demo which shows a decentralized model of fractal growth.  The more complicated Swarm demos show different types of "boids" models of flocking birds.  The Gravity demo is a simple simulation using physical simulation features, while the Walker and SuperWalker demos is a more complicated example in which a simulated creature learns how to walk. 
<P>
To run a demo, simply select the demo from the "Demo" menu, and push the play button.  Make changes in the code window and restart the demo to see how your changes affect the simulation.
<P>
After trying the demos, you can consult the <a href="http://www.spiderland.org/breve/docs">breve documentation</a> to learn more about writing simulations in breve.

<H4><b>known bugs</b></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Fullscreen mode (OS X) does not currently work on all machines with all monitor settings.  Lowering resolution or the number of colors may help.
