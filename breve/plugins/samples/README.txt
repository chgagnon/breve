   Sample Plugins for The breve Simulation Environment
             http://www.spiderland.org/breve

This sample directory contains two very simple examples of 
building breve plugins.  These examples show trivial examples 
of how C and C++ code can be accessed from breve simulations.

To build the samples, type "make".

Full instructions on creating plugins for breve can be found
in the breve documentation:
