<body>
slQTMusic is a breve plugin (for Mac OS X only) which gives access to 
QuickTime musical instruments.  This allows music to be played using
QuickTime's built-in MIDI instrument synthesizer.
<p>
slQTMusic is accessed through the class Instrument.  If the slQTMusic
plugin is loaded, simply import the file "Instrument.tz".  Each instance
of the Instrument class corresponds to a single voice with a specific 
synthesized instrument--several different Instrument instances may be used 
at the same time.
<p>
To use an Instrument, it must first be initialized as a specific specific
synthesizer instrument such as piano, violin, etc.  
<p>
There are then two techniques to play notes: 1) to play notes from
one instrument at a time 2) to play notes from several instruments
at a time.
<p>
To play notes for a single instrument at a time, use the methods play-note 
or play-chord.
<p>
To play notes for multiple instruments at the same time, you should use
the method start-note for each instrument to begin playing, then later
call stop-note for each instrument.  The notes should be given time to
play using the controller method sleep.  
<p>
In either case, the notes are identified by number codes with 60 
corresponding to middle C.
<p>
The methods of this class are described below.
<p>
<b>+ to init-as-piano:</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Initializes the Instrument object as a piano.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ to init-as-violin:</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Initializes the Instrument object as a violin.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ to init-as-cello:</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Initializes the Instrument object as a cello.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ to init-as-vibraphone:</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Initializes the Instrument object as a vibraphone.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ to init-as-instrument number n (int):</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Initializes the Instrument object as the QuickTime instrument identified
by number.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ to play-note number n (int) for-duration duration (double) with-volume volume = 80 (int):</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Plays a note, given as a MIDI note number, for a certain duration, in seconds.
The optional argument volume specifies the volume of the note to be played.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ to play-chord with-notes notes (list) for-duration duration (double) with-volume volume = 80 (int):</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Plays a chord, given as list MIDI note number, for a certain duration, in 
seconds.
The optional argument volume specifies the volume of the chord to be played.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ to start-note number n (int) with-volume volume = 80 (int):</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Starts playing a note, with the given MIDI note number.  The note will
continue to be played until stop-last-note is called.
The optional argument volume specifies the volume of the note to be played.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ to stop-last-note:</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
If a note has been started using start-note, this method stops the note.
